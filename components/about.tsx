            <p>
                I'm a data analyst and developer based in Texas with strong interests in distributed systems and decentralization.
                Outside of work, you can find me rock climbing ðŸ§—, training Brazilian jiu-jitsu ðŸ¥‹, or
                immersed in a book ðŸ“–. I'm also avid chess player, so click <a href="http://chess.com/play/eek_kim">â™˜</a> if you wish to challenge me.
                I have aspirations on becoming a full-stack software architect, so please connect to follow me on my journey!
            </p>
